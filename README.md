#### TypeScript
What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is JavaScript with Staic Type Checking. You can think of it as a tool that runs before your code and esures that the type of the program are correct

    Once TypeScript's compiler is done, it erases the types to produce the plain compiled JavaScript we are used to

### Static Type Checking
What is Static Type Checking?
    Static Checking is when something, like your compiler, runs before your code and checks for erros

    Type Checking is making sure the variables you are using fit the current context.
    Example: You're not tring to subtract a string form a number => 7 - "Words"

    Static Type Checking is when something, like TypeScript, will detect the typing erros
    in your code, before it runs.
